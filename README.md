### I have created these 2 functions. One function creates an environment with matrix, its inverse and 4 functions (get/set/getinverse/setinverse). Another function is an auxillary that helps to calculate an inverse of the matrix and subsequently cache it. Once cached the inverse can be accessed without doing the resource intensive calcualtions.
